# :game_die: Dice Game :game_die:

This is a basic dice game I made, further exploring the use of JavaScript and it's applicability within the browser.

## Rules :pushpin:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- Every round a player rolls the dice as many times as he/she whishes. Each result will be added to his ```ROUND``` score. ```The score within the red box labelled current```
- However, if the player rolls a 1, his ```ROUND``` score gets lost and goes back to 0. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to ```HOLD```, which means that his ```ROUND``` score gets added to his ```GL0BAL``` score. ```The GLOBAL score is largely displayed number under Player 1/2.```
- If you press ```HOLD``` it locks in your ```ROUND``` score and therefore, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach ```100``` points on ```GLOBAL``` score wins the game!
